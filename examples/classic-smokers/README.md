## Unstated Dependencies

Generation depends on [NetworkX](https://networkx.org) for building scale-free graphs, and evaluation compares with [ProbLog](https://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/problog/). The former is a dependency of Sherlog, but both can be installed with:
```
python3 -m pip install problog networkx
```
